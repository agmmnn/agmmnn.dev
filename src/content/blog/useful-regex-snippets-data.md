Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used for pattern matching and text manipulation. They allow users to search, extract, and replace specific sequences of characters within a text. In this article, we will explore ten useful regex snippets that can streamline various text processing tasks.

#### Extracting Text Between Two Strings: `first.*?second`

- Snippet (exclusive, with lookaround): `(?<=first)(.\*?)(?=second)`
- Snippet (exclusive without lookaround): `(?<=first).\*?(?=second)`

These regex snippets are useful for extracting text between two specific strings ("first" and "second"). The inclusive version includes the strings "first" and "second," while the exclusive versions exclude them.

#### Extracting Multiline Text between Two Strings:

- `first([\S\s]*?)second`
- `first(.*?)second`
- `(?<=first)(.*)(?=second)`
- `^(?!first|second)(.*)$`

These regex snippets are variations for extracting multiline text between two strings ("first" and "second"). They account for different line breaks and conditions while capturing the desired content effectively.

#### Removing Line Breaks: `"\r\n" => " "`

Line breaks can sometimes hinder text analysis or processing. This simple regex snippet replaces all occurrences of \r\n with a space, effectively removing the line breaks and merging lines into a single continuous text.

#### Identifying Lone Empty Lines: `^\r\n`

This regex snippet matches lines that contain only a line break, effectively identifying empty lines. Useful for cleaning up text files and removing unnecessary empty spaces.

#### Finding Lines Starting with Numbers: `^\d.\*`

This regex snippet identifies lines that start with a numeric digit. It's helpful for extracting or filtering lines that begin with numbers, such as ordered lists or numeric data.

#### Removing Specific Line Breaks:

- `\n+(?!(?:Q|M):)`
- `\n+(?!(?:Question|Answer):)`

These regex snippets remove line breaks but exclude specific patterns followed by a colon (e.g., "Q:", "M:", "Question:", etc.). It's useful for cleaning up text files with specific formatting requirements.

#### Filtering Non-Digits and Digits:

- Snippet for Non-Digits: `\D`
- Snippet for Digits: `\d`

These regex snippets are helpful for filtering out non-digit characters (using \D) or extracting only digit characters (using \d) from a text string.

#### Matching Lines with up to 8 Characters: `^.{1,8}$`

This regex snippet identifies lines that contain between 1 to 8 characters. Useful for finding short lines or enforcing specific text length requirements.

#### Identifying Empty Lines: `^$\n`

This regex snippet matches completely empty lines (lines with no characters, including spaces). It's handy for cleaning up text files and removing blank lines.

#### Matching Null Characters: `\x00`

This regex snippet matches null characters, represented by \x00. Null characters can be identified and removed from text data when necessary.

### Conclusion:

Regex snippets are valuable tools for text manipulation and data processing tasks. From removing line breaks to extracting specific patterns, these ten useful snippets provide practical solutions to various text-related challenges. By leveraging regular expressions, you can efficiently manage and process textual data to suit your needs.
